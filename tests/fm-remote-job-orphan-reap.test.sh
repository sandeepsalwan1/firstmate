# The leak this pins: a worker launched from a worktree's own bin/ outlives that
# worktree. Its restart supervisor sits above the serving child, so killing the
# recorded worker pid only makes the supervisor respawn, and nothing else ever
# stops it. Observed 2026-08-07 as 29 workers at ppid 1, 1-2 days old, each
# still appending to a log in a pruned no-mistakes gate worktree.
#
# The reaper sweeps every worker for this user. These cases restrict its process
# scan to their fixture workers so a test run cannot stop another worker.
