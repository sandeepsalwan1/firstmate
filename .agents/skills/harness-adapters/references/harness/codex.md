# Codex

Verified on 2026-06-11 with codex-cli 0.139.0 unless a fact gives a newer version.

## Operating facts

| Fact | Value |
|---|---|
| Busy state | Unknown until a turn-level source is live-verified: the pane app-server lifecycle is unreachable, and enabled project hooks do not yet provide a verified worker turn protocol. |
| Exit command | `/quit`; its slash popup needs about one second between text and Enter, which the shared submit path used by the control plane handles. |
| Interrupt | Single Escape. |
| Skill invocation | `$<skill>`, for example `$no-mistakes`; `/<skill>` is Claude-only and Codex rejects it as "Unrecognized command". |
| Resume | `codex resume <session-id>`, using the id printed on quit. |
| Model flag | `--model <model>`. |
| Effort flag | `-c 'model_reasoning_effort="<low\|medium\|high\|xhigh\|max>"'`; see [crew dispatch profiles](../../../../../docs/configuration.md) for model-scoped `max` support. |
| Model discovery | Open the current interactive session's `/model` picker. |
| Marker | None; identity comes from ancestry, and `../../../bin/fm-harness.sh` is what keeps a retained foreign `CLAUDECODE` from renaming it. Verified on 2026-09-01 with codex-cli 0.152.0: the pane process is the `node` npm shim and the native `codex` binary runs as its foreground child, so a tool subprocess reaches the native name directly while the shim itself is identified from its script path. |

A directory trust dialog appears on the first run for a repository root: "Do you trust the contents of this directory?"
Accept it with Enter and verify the instructions begin processing.
The decision persists for the repository, so later worktrees of the same project skip it.

## Hook trust

Verified on 2026-09-28 with Codex 0.158: `--dangerously-bypass-hook-trust` runs enabled machine and project hooks without a persisted trust prompt.
Firstmate passes this flag for crewmates, scouts, and secondmates.
It does not write Codex's trust store.
Crewmates and scouts keep their separate `-c notify=` turn-end signal.

## Skill popup

A `$<skill>` invocation opens a `$` autocomplete popup.
Submitting too fast lets the popup swallow Enter, so the invocation never lands.
`../../../bin/fm-send.sh` gives a leading `$` a 1.2-second settle before the first Enter only when the exact task metadata records `harness=codex`, with the target backend's submit retry as the safety net.
That scope is load-bearing because a leading `$` commonly starts ordinary text such as `$5/month` or `$HOME`.
An explicit `session:window` target has no metadata, so its harness is unknown and uses the non-Codex fast path.
This is why `$no-mistakes` reaches a Codex worker instead of being consumed by the popup.

## Primary integration

The primary integration was verified on 2026-07-08 with codex-cli 0.142.1.
The firstmate primary's `.codex/hooks.json` registers a Stop hook that pipes Codex's payload to `../../../bin/fm-turnend-guard.sh`.
Codex Stop hooks preserve exit status 2 and stderr to block, and expose `stop_hook_active` for the same one-block loop safety used by the guard's default mode.

The Stop payload includes `cwd`, but the tracked hook does not use it to choose the guard executable.
Codex runs the Stop command with process PWD set to the hook-loaded project root, while no `CODEX_PROJECT_DIR`, `CODEX_WORKSPACE_ROOT`, or `CODEX_CWD` root variable is set.
The tracked hook anchors to `pwd -P`, verifies that root is Firstmate-shaped and hook-bearing, and then invokes the guard with the original payload.

Codex's primary watcher protocol is `../../../bin/fm-watch-checkpoint.sh --seconds "${FM_CODEX_WATCH_CHECKPOINT:-180}"`, not `../../../bin/fm-watch-arm.sh`.
Codex cannot reason while a foreground tool call is running, so the checkpoint is deliberately foreground and bounded to return control regularly for user messages and queued notifications.
In a home with `config/supervision-host` the checkpoint runs the supervision host instead of the watcher, with Claude's print mode as its headless engine, and holds for at least an hour while away; [`supervision-host.md`](../../../../../docs/supervision-host.md) owns the host and that bound.
Codex's PreToolUse watcher-arm seatbelt blocks directly through its project hook.
